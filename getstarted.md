To get started, go to your platform's app store on your mobile device:

<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nametaggle/id1479297455"><img src ="./assets/download-app-store.png"></a></td>
<td><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nametaggle.nametaggle&hl=en_US"><img src ="./assets/download-google-play.png"></a></td>
</tr>
</table>

All you'll need is an Organization's Join Code, which you can get from an administrator of that organization. Then create your own profile and have a look around!
