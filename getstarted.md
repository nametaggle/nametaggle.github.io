To get started, install the mobile phone application from your platform's app store:

<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nametaggle/id1479297455"><img src ="./assets/download-app-store.png"></a></td>
<td><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nametaggle.nametaggle&hl=en_US"><img src ="./assets/download-google-play.png"></a></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h1>Second...</h1>
Setup your account.  It usually takes 3-5 minutes. If you already have your Organization's Join Code, you probably have everything you need.  If you need help, there are <a href="/procedures/010-NewUserSignup/">step-by-step instructions</a> to guide you through the process or you can watch a tutorial video (coming soon).

<h1>And then...</h1>
You're ready to enjoy NameTaggle.  You can add a family picture, join groups and checkout everyone else's NameTaggle profile!
