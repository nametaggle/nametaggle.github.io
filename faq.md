#### How is NameTaggle different from social media platforms?
NameTaggle is different because it is not social media.  NameTaggle is intended to be used infrequently, primarily when you want to remember someone's name, contact information, or what organizational groups they belong to.  There are no advertisements or stream of user activity.  NameTaggle is more like a modern yearbook or pictorial directory for your phone than social media.

#### Is NameTaggle secure?
NameTaggle was designed from the beginning to be secure because the user only enters information commonly found in a phone book. We also give users the option to manage which organizations can see your personal information like phone number and address. The developer of NameTaggle focused the last 10 years of his career on large enterprise information security and managing projects and developing software at one of the largest US banks.  He brings all of that knowledge and experience to NameTaggle.

#### What types of privacy controls does NameTaggle provide?
NameTaggle allows you to control which organizations can see your phone numbers, address, family picture, etc.  For example you may want to share your home phone number with a civic organization but prefer your work colleagues only have access to your mobile phone.

#### How does NameTaggle provide this service without advertisements?
NameTaggle provides a paid service for organizations.  Individual user accounts are free, but organizations pay for the service based on how many individual profiles they have attached to their organization.  We do not sell or disclose your personal information to anyone outside the app.

#### Will NameTaggle send a lot of spam notifications?
No.  NameTaggle as a platform sends you minimal emails and text messages.  Organizations that you join can send you push notifications and emails with their own updates.  NameTaggle will not share your contact information with 3rd parties.
