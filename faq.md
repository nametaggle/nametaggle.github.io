###### How is NameTaggle different from social media platforms?

NameTaggle is very different from most social media platforms.  NameTaggle is intended to be used infrequently - primarily when you want to remember someone's name or what organizational groups they belong to.

###### Is NameTaggle secure?

NameTaggle was designed from the beginning to be secure.  First, we don't want you to enter any information that you wouldn't put in a phone book.  The developer of NameTaggle focused five years of his career on information security for large enterprises and five years before that managing projects and developing software at one of the largest US banks.  We also give you the option to manage which organizations can see your personal information like phone number and address.
