<h1 class="perm-marker">Civic Organizations</h1>
Civic organizations use NameTaggle to grow their membership.  As people join the organization and feel comfortable because they know everyone's name they can be more welcoming to new members.  Notifications can remind groups like meal committees or volunteers of commitments.
