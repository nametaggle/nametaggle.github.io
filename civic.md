<h1 class="perm-marker">Civic Organizations</h1>
Members of Civic Organizations already have a lot in common but it's hard to know what you have in common with who. Plus it's a lot of names to keep up with when most groups don't meet very often. Enter: NameTaggle. Beyond the picture and contact information directory, Civic Organizations are using NameTaggle to keep members notifed of upcoming events, committee needs, and volunteer opportunities. It changes the dynamic of the organization for the better when people know one anothers' names and feel more connected. It changes the effectiveness of the organization for the better when all members know what's going on and where the needs are. As an added bonus, potential new members will feel more welcomed and are more likely to join. NameTaggle is what enables all of the above.
