<h1 class="perm-marker">Apartment Complexes</h1>

Can an app really help an apartment complex feel more like a community? Absolutely. NameTaggle allows activity groups to self-organize and notify those who are interested about everything that's happening. As new residents move in, they can jump right into the community with connections they make via NameTaggle. Additionally, community managers can notify everyone of upcoming events and important annoucements.
