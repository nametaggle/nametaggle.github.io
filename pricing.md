##### Our Pricing Model
NameTaggle is the work of a small team with a single developer. To keep it ad-free and high-quality, we charge our users a modest subscription fee. We keep our pricing simple by basing it on two variables: the number of users in your organization and the number of notifications youâ€™re allotted. *A single notification can be sent to an entire organization or to just one individual*.

##### Basic Users - FREE
Basic Users can maintain an individual and family profile and share these with as many organizations as they join.

##### Plus Users - $5/year
Plus Users can create and manage 1 organization with up to 25 Members. This includes administrative control over delegating privileges and managing notifications. 

##### Gold Users - $10/year
Gold Users can create and manage 1 organization with up to 50 Members. As with Plus Users, this includes administrative control over delegating privileges and managing notifications.

##### Small Organization - $150/year
Subscriptions can also start at the organization level. Small Organizations get all user features for up to 150 users, as well as the ability to use notifications.

##### Medium Organization - $500/year
Medium Organizations can include up to 500 users and gain access to extended support.
