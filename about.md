<h1 class= "perm-marker">NameTaggle's Story</h1>
<p>It all started with a simple question: "Why doesn't our church have an app?"</p>

<p>This perked my ears since mobile app development is one of my hobbies. The immediate need at our church was a current pictorial directory. Our church traditionally hired a photographer, worked to schedule as many members as possible for pictures, and then produced a nice booklet with family pictures and contact information. The problem was the printed booklet was outdated before it arrived because new members are always joining the church and not all current members will come for photographs. Pictorial directories are necessary and yet time consuming and expensive.</p>

<p>NameTaggle provides a better way.</p>

<p>Pictures and contact information can be updated in real time so the church directory is always current. There is a low annual cost to the organization. Since most of us have our phones with us, the directory is always available when you forget a name.</p>

<p>I created the original application and started sharing it with friends. One of those friends told me he could really use something like it for his work.  I was caught off-guard. Up until that moment, I had only dreamed of a mobile church pictorial directory. His insight was inspirational - forgetting people's names isn't limited to religious organizations, and this app could help lots of people connect with others in their various organizations.</p>

<p>I laid aside my other consulting business and decided to focus all my energy on building NameTaggle. It took time to learn new languages, platforms, and weave security into everything. In December 2019, I finally felt good enough to launch NameTaggle with a larger audience.</p>
