<p>We developed NameTaggle to be a value driven product from the beginning.  We intentionally limited staff and focused on quality to keep costs low.  We make money through subscriptions not advertisements.  It is our intention to keep advertisements out of NameTaggle and let the service provide value for the users and customers.</p>
