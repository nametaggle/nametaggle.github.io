<p>NameTaggle can help you make connections in all of your organizations.

Once your group joins NameTaggle, everyone is grouped by Organization. You control what information gets shared with each organization.</p>

<h5 id="groups">Groups</h5>
<p>Every organization has groups of people that “do” things together.  For a business, this might be workplace locations or organizational units like “Marketing”.  Religious organizations may have groups like study groups or committees.</p>

<h5 id="families">Families</h5>
<p>Some organizations benefit from family pictures, especially neighborhoods and religious organizations.  NameTaggle allows you to choose which organizations can see your family picture.  You can include a caption and associate  members individual pictures with the family.</p>

<h5 id="individuals">Individuals</h5>
<p>Individuals are the core feature of NameTaggle.  Every indivdual has a profile picture and the ability to include a short note about themselves.  At this time we don’t allow individual younger than 13 to have their own login, but parents can create a profile for minors.</p>

<h5 id="interests">Interests</h5>

<p>The feature that started it all.  Administrators can generate new directories and upload previous year’s directories so they’re all in one place.</p>

<h5 id="notifications-new">Notifications <em>NEW</em></h5>
<p>We’ve just added notifications.  Unlike other social media platforms, NameTaggle won’t notify you about every message or post that occured on the platform.  Instead NameTaggle provides a daily summary of how many new messages you have waiting to read. Instead of deleting or archiving messages - the sender puts an expiration date that will clear them from your inbox.</p>

<h5 id="sticky-notes">Sticky Notes</h5>
<p>We know it’s nice to have a private place to remember things about people  NameTaggle has private sticky notes you can attach to people to help you remember things they didn’t include in their profile.  Later you can search to find the unique skill you jotted down but couldn’t remember who it was.</p>
