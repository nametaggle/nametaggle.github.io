<p>It can be embarrassing to walk into a remote office and forget someoneâ€™s name.  With NameTaggle, each office can organize itself with a group and a few swipes later you found the needed reminder of everyone youâ€™re about to meet.</p>

<h5 id="shared-workspaces">Shared Workspaces</h5>
<p>Modern work environments are often shared between multiple businesses.  Itâ€™s easy to have several water cooler conversations with someone and forget their name.  Who do you even ask for a reminder?  Why not invite them to join NameTaggle and then the reminder is only a few taps away.</p>
