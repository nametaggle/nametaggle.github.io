Once your group joins NameTaggle, everyone is grouped by Organization. You control what information gets shared with each organization.</p>

<h5 id="groups">Groups</h5>

<p>The feature that started it all.  Administrators can generate new directories and upload previous year‚Äôs directories so they‚Äôre all in one place.</p>

<h5 id="notifications-new">Notifications <em>NEW</em></h5>
<p>We‚Äôve just added notifications.  Unlike other social media platforms, NameTaggle won‚Äôt notify you about every message or post that occured on the platform.  Instead NameTaggle provides a daily summary of how many new messages you have waiting to read. Instead of deleting or archiving messages - the sender puts an expiration date that will clear them from your inbox.</p>
