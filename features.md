##### Multiple Organizations
NameTaggle allows you to maintain connections within multiple organizations. It’s easy to switch from viewing members of your Parent Teacher Association Board to finding the owner of a dog loose on your street. Once your group joins NameTaggle, everyone is grouped by Organization. You control what information gets shared with each organization.

##### Groups
Every organization has groups of people that “do” things together. For a business, this might be workplace locations or organizational units like “Marketing”. Religious organizations may have groups like Sunday School classes or committees. NameTaggle users can join or show interest in notifications from as many groups as they want within your organization.

##### Families
Some organizations benefit from family pictures, especially neighborhoods and religious organizations. NameTaggle allows you to choose which organizations can see your family picture. You can include a caption and associate members individual pictures with the family.

##### Individuals
Individuals are the core feature of NameTaggle. Every individual has a profile picture and the ability to include a short note about themselves. At this time we don’t allow individual younger than 13 to have their own login, but parents can create a profile for minors.

##### Interests
Interests are topics or events you like, but aren’t actually a member. In an office, this might include after-work events while at a religious organization interests might include musical performances or service opportunities.

##### Administrative Controls
Within each organization, users with Administrative privileges can control what features and available to users and user groups.

##### Printable Directory
The feature that started it all. Administrators can generate new directories and upload previous year’s directories so they’re all in one place.

##### Notifications *NEW*
We’ve just added notifications. Unlike other social media platforms, NameTaggle won’t notify you about every message or post that occured on the platform. Instead NameTaggle provides a daily summary of how many new messages you have waiting to read. Instead of deleting or archiving messages - the sender puts an expiration date that will clear them from your inbox.

##### Sticky Notes
We know it’s nice to have a private place to remember things about people, so NameTaggle has private sticky notes you can attach to user images to help you remember things they didn’t include in their profile. Later you can search to find the unique skill you jotted down but couldn’t remember who it was.
