##### Multiple Organizations
NameTaggle can help you make connections in all of your organizations.  It's easy switch from viewing members of your Parent Teacher Association Board to finding the parents of a lost child in the neighborhood.  Once your group joins NameTaggle, everyone is grouped by Organization. You control what information gets shared with each organization.

##### Groups
Every organization has groups of people that "do" things together.  For a business, this might be workplace locations or organizational units like "Marketing".  Religious organizations may have groups like study groups or committees.

##### Families
Some organizations benefit from family pictures, especially neighborhoods and religious organizations.  NameTaggle allows you to choose which organizations can see your family picture.  You can include a caption and associate  members individual pictures with the family.

##### Individuals
Individuals are the core feature of NameTaggle.  Every indivdual has a profile picture and the ability to include a short note about themselves.  At this time we don't allow individual younger than 13 to have their own login, but parents can create a profile for minors.

##### Interests
Interests are topics or events you like, but aren't actually a member.  In an office, this might include after-work events while at a religious organization interest might include musical performances or service opportunities.

##### Administrative Controls
Within each organization, users with Administrative privileges can control what features and available to users and user groups.

##### Printable Directory
The feature that started it all.  Administrators can generate new directories and upload previous year's directories so they're all in one place.

##### Notifications *NEW*
We've just added notifications.  Unlike other social media platforms, NameTaggle won't notify you about every message or post that occured on the platform.  Instead NameTaggle provides a daily summary of how many new messages you have waiting to read. Instead of deleting or archiving messages - the sender puts an expiration date that will clear them from your inbox.
